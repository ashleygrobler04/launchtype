# Launchtype

This is a launcher that can be used with the press of ctrl+alt+space (maybe I will make it configurable later).

You will be able to add comands that can be assigned to abreviations (optional) and then, by entering them in the input field, you will be able to run these commands.

This is useful mostly for running websites quickly, or running a shell script or opening a folder buried in your OS.

## Usage

TBD
